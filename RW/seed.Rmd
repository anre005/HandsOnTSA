# `set.seed()`
The `set.seed()` function is needed to specify the state of `R`'s internal random number generator (RNG). 
Without this function we are not able to achive reproducible results.

```{r setseed}
rnorm(10, mean = 10, sd = 2)
```

```{r setseed1}
set.seed(123)
rnorm(10, mean = 10, sd = 2)
```

```{r setseed2}
set.seed(123)
rnorm(10, mean = 10, sd = 2)
```
